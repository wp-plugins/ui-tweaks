== Description ==

Adds various tweaks the WordPress Admin UI. More specifically to increase visibility and usability. All features are in a constant state of beta, there are no guarantees and a modern browser is mandatory!

Special thanks to John O'Nolan's UI Labs plugin which gave me the inspiration to tinker with the UI and started me off.

== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip the archive and put the 'ui-tweaks' folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

== Screenshots ==

1. The header changes made through CSS.
